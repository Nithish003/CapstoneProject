This work describes a supervised deep-learning-based skin lesion classification system that classifies eight categories of cancerous skin tissues, where images were provided by International Skin Cancer Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) in 2019. We trained and tuned parameters of an AlexNet deep learning neural network architecture to learn about eight categories based on a training set provided by ISIC, cross-validated it on that set, and submitted results to ISIC website to have the trained algorithm evaluated. We report that, by employing data augmentation, which includes rotated, cropped, and noisy versions of the original images, the cross-validation accuracy improved to around 79% and the area under the curve (AUC) of the test results improved to around 78%, from 50%.
